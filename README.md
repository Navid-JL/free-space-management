# Splitting and Coalescing in Operating Systems: Free Space Management

This GitHub project provides a C# implementation that simulates the splitting and coalescing process in operating systems' free space management. It serves as an example inspired by the "Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces" book by Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.

## Features

-   Memory allocation and deallocation simulation
-   Efficient splitting and coalescing of free memory spaces

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Navid-JL/free-space-management`
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the program.

## Usage

The program initializes a memory space and performs memory allocation and deallocation operations. After each operation, the current memory status is displayed. Modify the code as needed to suit your requirements.
